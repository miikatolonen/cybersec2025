- 3b (The management plan is limited to known attacks but thoroughly covers the likely impacts of these attacks)

Tietoniekat Oy had finally completed its first cyber incident and disruption plan. Every service is now covered and explicitly mapped. 
According to Pekka there are now clear response procedures, communication channels and recovery processes. On the other hand, Liisa pointed out that
the plan is still limited to some known types of attacks, such as ransomware and phishing. The impacts are documented in the plan. Tech Lead Jaakko
has defined the technical steps for isolating affected systems and restoring from backups. Marjatta suggested that they should be further developed and
next iteration of development should go deeper in these topics. They will have soon another meeting where they conclude development activities.
