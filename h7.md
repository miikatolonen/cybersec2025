Exercise: Data state canvas. Data at rest, data in transit, data in-use.


### Security architecture and engineering

- NIST, ISO27001, COBIT
- cryptography, vulnerabilities, architecture

Exercise: Vulnerability management. Design vulnerability management for imaginary company

### Communication and Network security

- OSI, TCP and IP models, protocols, IT/OT, VPN, firewall, network segmentation

Exercise: Network architecture for imaginary company

Exercise: create access control matrix for imaginary company

### Security assessment and testing

- Pentesting, vulnerability scanning, auditing

Exercise: Review of penetration testing results and task creation

### Security operations

Incident management, patching, disaster recovery, post-mortems

Exercise: create a disaster recovery plan for imaginary company

### Software development security

DevSecOps, software development lifecycle, SAST/DAST/SCA scanning and best practices in coding

Exercise: improve secure software development practices for imaginary company

After this course it is possible to pursue a CISSP certificate. This course would last 3-4 months and every domain should have atleast 2 lessons. 
Length of this course would be 60 hours of lectures and 100-150 hours of independent work.
I would like to have guests from different top-notch security companies, such as WithSecure and others. Also, it would be good that there would be guests from private and public sector and from different backgrounds.
