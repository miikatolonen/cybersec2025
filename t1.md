#	What are the key areas being researched?
*	The key areas being researched by Alhogail and Alkahtani (2024) are automated penetration testing, black box testing, white box testing and grey box testing.
*	 When penetration testing is automated, it increases scalability of testing and it makes repeatable assessments possible.
*  Also, one should focus on critical vulnerabilities and their detection rates. They also research automated and manual testing and the combination between these two.
*  They are proposing architecture for comprehensive automated testing.	
# What's widely agreed upon?
*	It is widely agreed upon that there are not a single tool that is enough. Automation makes testing scalable and efficient. It offers wide benefits to organizations that do not have enough resources. Manual testing is still critical since there might be a mix of business logic vulnerabilities in code that might affect the product and that kind of problems are usually hard for automation tools.
#	What are the open questions?
*	How testing tools handle different environments? 
*	How to get the most accurate result?
*	How to integrate these testing tools with automation? (e.g. CI/CD)
*	How new emerging technologies will affect penetration testing? 
*	What is the best way to combine manual and automated testing?
