# x) Applied cryptography
- basic goals of cryptography: confidentiality, integrity, availability, nonrepudiation in digital communication
- Symmetric cryptography uses same key to encrypt and decrypt data (AES)
- Asymmetric cryptography uses public key for encryption and secret key for decryption (RSA, ECDSA etc)
- Even strong algorithms can be breaked by bad design
#PGP
- gpg tool for using opengpg from CLI
- few commands such as gpg --gen-key for key creation
- gpg --export --armor --output for sharing public key in untrusted channels
- pgp is a hybrid protocol

# a) Pubkey today. Explain how you have used public key cryptography today or yesterday, outside of this homework. In addition to naming the system, identify how different parties use keys in different steps of the system.

I have used public key cryptography a lot, for example accessing web pages etc. 
Different parties: 
- I go to https:// and initiate TLS session
- Client hello
- Server hello
- Certificate validation by browser
- client and server exchange keys
- => shared secret
- => symmetric session keys
- Finished command

# b) AES 256 encryption:
- symmetric block cipher
- both parties share the same key
- key sharing happens on other protocol
- security depends on the other protocol that is doing the sharing
- used in combination with https / tls, pgp, disk / file encryption

# c) PGP: Eve and Mallory
Alice: sender
Bob: recipient
Mallory: Active attacker
Eve: eavesdropper

- If Alice encrypts to Bob public key, Eve can only get cipher text but not decoded text. Eve can still get other information from network.
- Mallory can try to pretend to be Bob and publish his public key
- PGP protects from passive attackers, always verify keys

# d) Password manager 

- easy to use and not necessary to memorize all passwords
- you can add complexity to passwords without a need to remember those
- you can use them in mobile
- if you lose your password to manager you usually lose all passwords inside it
- if someone gets master password then every password is compromised
